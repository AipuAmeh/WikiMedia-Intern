/*
* TODO A: Modify or add styles to make the page look *roughly* like the design
spec file at `design-spec/layout.png`. Don't worry about making it pixel perfect
or matching the colors/spacing exactly. Instead, focus on the alignment of
elements. Elements that appear to be horizontally or vertically centered in the
spec, should be made that way here.

  * 
  Add flexbox to the header and display items evenly
  Center entire content using flex on main content/body
  Add width to text box
 
  /*

* TODO B: Ensure that the page is responsive for tablet and mobile.

	Add media queries for tablet and mobile screens
